            <p>My name is Mariano Marra. I'm 40 years old. I love It. I'm working with computers since i graduated from high school.
                 I started working at a cyber-bar, repairing PCs, installing software and maintaing the network. A couple of years
                  later, I opened my ow PC Shop which was open during 3 years. After that, I got a job in the Goverment. There, i 
                had several groups in charge like Level 1 and Level 2 support and Assets Managemen. During the last three years,
            and besides those three roles, I was working in Proccess Analysis and Automation and some R&D Cloud projects.</p>
